## Working with JSON

- JSON is purely a string with a specified data format â€” it contains only properties, no methods.
- JSON requires double quotes to be used around strings and property names. Single quotes are not valid other than surrounding the entire JSON string.
- Even a single misplaced comma or colon can cause a JSON file to go wrong, and not work. You should be careful to validate any data you are attempting to use (although computer-generated JSON is less likely to include errors, as long as the generator program is working correctly). You can validate JSON using an application like [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/).
- JSON can actually take the form of any data type that is valid for inclusion inside JSON, not just arrays or objects. So for example, a single string or number would be valid JSON.
- Unlike in JavaScript code in which object properties may be unquoted, in JSON only quoted strings may be used as properties.
