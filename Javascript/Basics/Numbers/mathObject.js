/**
 * Math.round()
Math.round() rounds a number to the nearest integer.

Math.ceil()
Math.ceil() rounds a number to the smallest integer greater than it. You can think of it like this: a ceiling is the top of a room - therefore a number ceiled goes to its top integer.

Math.floor()
Math.floor() rounds a number to the largest integer smaller than it. You can think of it like this: a floor is the bottom of a room - therefore a number floored goes to its bottom integer.

Math.pow()
Math.pow() raises its first argument to the power of the second argument.

Math.min()
Math.min() returns the minimum number from a given list of arguments

Math.abs()
Math.abs() gives the absolute value of a number.

 * Math.random()
Math.random() returns a pseudo-generated random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).

Math.sin(), Math.cos() and Math.tan()
Math.sin(*), Math.cos() and Math.tan() return the sin, cosine and tangents of angles (in radians) respectively.
